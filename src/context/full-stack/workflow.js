export const workflow = `
Beginning of a feature implementation or solving a problem, I frame box the 
problem/feature within some design patterns to keep the implementation clean 
and scalable. While writing code, I focus on design principles to 
keep code readable and maintainable. As a passionate software developer, I write 
tests of my code, do daily scrum, review pull request, share own opinion 
and thus try to play the role of a team player.
