export const about = `
I am a backend-heavy full-stack developer and polyglot programmer based on Java, Kotlin, JavaScript & TypeScript. I follow SOLID principles and keep my code clean and readable so that my co-workers can understand and refactor my code easily. Besides that I am used to writing test coverages by myself.
I have a dream to become a software architect one day and to make it true I have already earned some knowledge and techniques how to design a software part by part.
